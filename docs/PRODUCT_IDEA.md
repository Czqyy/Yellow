Open-Source Pay-per-Contribution via State Channels

Problem
Open-source contributors often work for free, aiming for reputation or future jobs. Sponsorships and grants are lumpy and slow. Micro-payments ($1â€“$10) per small fix/docs/test are infeasible with traditional rails due to fees.

Solution (State Channels)
- Owner opens a state channel and deposits stablecoins or project tokens.
- Each accepted contribution produces an off-chain, signed balance update (instant credit).
- Channel settles on-chain at session end; trust enforced cryptographically.

Why Better Than Traditional
- Instant micro-payments per contribution
- No legal contracts; cryptographic commitments
- Open and global onboarding; not limited to grant cycles
- Gasless and scalable; off-chain accounting
- Fair rewards for small contributions

Example Flow
- Deposit: $500 USDC
- Bug fix: +$5 off-chain credit
- Docs: +$1 credit
- End of week settle: contributor nets $50, owner retains $450

Benefits
- Motivates micro-fixes, docs, tests, translations, tutorials
- Global participation via crypto wallets
- Low friction (no contracts, no banks)
- Scalable to thousands of contributions

Initial Scope
- Contracts: Channel factory, ERC-20 support, challenge/settlement
- Off-chain: Contribution verification, pricing rules, signature relay
- Web: Project onboarding, review queue, contributor dashboard

Future Work
- Reputation and anti-spam scoring
- Multi-contributor channels and team sessions
- Optional escrow with dispute windows
- AI-assisted triage and pricing ("AI Micro-API Marketplace" integration)
